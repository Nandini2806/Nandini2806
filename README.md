## ðŸŒ± Projects

Let me share a couple of projects I've worked on:

### Blood Banking Management System

- Description: The project is a proposed system enables donors to register and find blood banks based on their geographical location, allowing them to contribute to the                    emergency blood supply in a more organized and effective manner. The system also provides blood banks to manage their inventory and monitor blood supply and                 demand in real time. Furthermore, it seamlessly empowers hospitals to request blood units from nearby blood banks. It an authorization-based system having                   three roles - Super Admin, Admin and User. Super Admin can register and manage all the blood banks to the system. Admin can manage the donations, inventories                and consumptions of blood of patients and patients can see their information.
- Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL
- Demo:  [Github](https://github.com/Nandini2806/blood_banking)

### Covid-19 Data Analysis Project

- Description: Exploratory Data Analysis using Python and Tableau to build Covid-19 dashboard to get insights about Covid-19 global cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Technologies used: Python, Tableau

### Student Management System
- Description: A Console Application developed using Python and MySQL along with basic functionalities of result processing system.
- Technologies used: Python, MySQL

### Digital Snake Game
- Description: Developed a python-based digital snake game with a food generation feature, allowing the player to increase the snake's length and score high. Arrow keys
               can be used for navigation.
- Technologies used: Python

### Tic Tac Toe
- Description: Two-player game where players mark spaces on a 3*3 grid to complete horizontal, vertical, or diagonal combinations.
- Technologies used: C++

## Research Work
- Topic: Telecommunication Stocks Prediction using Long Short-Term Memory Model Neural Network [CoCole 2022, NIT Warangal ] (01/2023)
- Description: Developed a predictive model for the stock market performance of Telecommunication companies using LSTM, a cutting-edge deep-learning sequential model.                      Demonstrated superior performance of LSTM over other models by examining the impact of epochs on model accuracy.
